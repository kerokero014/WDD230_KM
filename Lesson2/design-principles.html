        <p>
          The website that Google has created for their search website is really
          good, using Hicks Law perfectly allowing the used to look right
          towards their logo, then their search bar. They achieved the websites
          main purpose which was tell people this is where you serach for
          things.

        <p>
          The purpose of the Churches website is to emphasize how much they can
          offer and how much content they have to share. They want everyone to
          be drawn to the middle with a great contrast and they have positioned
          links that might interest people at first and then links to more
          services. They have escalated their images to equally catch the
          attention of the reader/viewer.

        <p>
          Delta Airlines created a website where they used Fitts's Law a
          Principle used to focused the users attention to where the developer
          wants the focal point to be, using the least amount of time to find
          what you are looking for. Delta placed their most wanted links in this
          case where you would like to go is to find flights from and where to
          go, as well as the dates.
